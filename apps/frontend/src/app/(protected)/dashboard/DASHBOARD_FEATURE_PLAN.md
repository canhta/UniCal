# Dashboard Feature Plan

## 1. Overview

The Dashboard will serve as the primary landing page for authenticated users, providing a quick overview of their upcoming events, connected accounts, and potentially other relevant information or actions. The initial version will be simple, focusing on displaying a summary of upcoming events.

## 2. Core Requirements (Based on FRD & System Needs)

*   **Display Upcoming Events:** Show a list or a summarized view of the user's upcoming events from all connected and active calendars.
*   **Quick Access to Key Areas:** Provide easy navigation to other important sections like the full Calendar view, Integrations/Connected Accounts, and Settings.
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensure the dashboard is usable and looks good on various screen sizes.

## 3. Phase 1: Basic Upcoming Events Display

*   **[ ] Component Structure:**
    *   Create `DashboardPage` component (`app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx`).
    *   Create `UpcomingEvents` component (e.g., `src/components/dashboard/UpcomingEvents.tsx`).
*   **[ ] Data Fetching:**
    *   `DashboardPage` (as a Server Component) will fetch upcoming events (e.g., for the next 7 days) using the API client.
    *   The API endpoint might be something like `GET /api/events?view=upcoming&days=7` or similar.
*   **[ ] UI Display (`UpcomingEvents` component):**
    *   Display a list of events, showing at least:
        *   Event Title
        *   Date and Time (formatted nicely)
        *   Source Calendar (e.g., icon or color code if available/decided)
    *   If no upcoming events, display a friendly message.
    *   Consider a "View Full Calendar" link/button.
*   **[ ] Basic Layout:**
    *   The `DashboardPage` will use the main `Layout` (which includes navigation).
    *   Structure the page with a clear heading (e.g., "Dashboard" or "Welcome back, [User Name]!").
*   **[ ] Styling:**
    *   Apply basic styling for readability and a clean look, consistent with the rest of the application.

## 4. Phase 2: Enhancements (Post-MVP)

*   **[ ] Summary Statistics:**
    *   Display a count of events for today/this week.
    *   Show number of connected accounts.
*   **[ ] Quick Actions:**
    *   "Create Event" button.
    *   "Connect New Account" button/link.
*   **[ ] Recent Activity/Notifications Preview:**
    *   If an in-app notification system is built, show a snippet of recent notifications.
*   **[ ] Customization:**
    *   Allow users to customize what widgets or information they see on the dashboard (long-term).
*   **[ ] Loading/Error States:**
    *   Implement proper loading indicators while fetching data.
    *   Display user-friendly error messages if data fetching fails.

## 5. API Endpoints & Data (Frontend Perspective)

*   **Needs:**
    *   An API endpoint to fetch upcoming events, possibly with parameters for date range.
        *   Example: `GET /events?startDate=YYYY-MM-DD&endDate=YYYY-MM-DD` or `GET /events/upcoming?limit=10`
    *   Event data should include: `id`, `title`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `isAllDay`, `sourceCalendarName`, `sourceCalendarColor` (if available).
    *   User information (e.g., name for a personalized greeting) - likely available from the session/auth context.

## 6. Accessibility Considerations

*   Ensure proper heading structure.
*   Provide ARIA attributes for interactive elements if necessary.
*   Ensure good color contrast.
*   Keyboard navigability.

## 7. Testing Considerations

*   **Unit Tests:** For any utility functions or complex logic within components.
*   **Component Tests:** For `UpcomingEvents` and `DashboardPage` to verify rendering based on props and fetched data.
*   **Mocking:** Mock API calls for fetching events.

This plan will evolve as the dashboard requirements become more detailed and other features of the application are developed.
