# Settings Feature Plan

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the plan for the User Settings feature in the frontend. This section will allow users to manage their profile information, account settings, notification preferences, and potentially application-specific preferences, aligning with FRD sections related to User Account Management and Application Configuration.

## 2. Key Features
-   **Profile Management (Ref: FRD User Profile Management):**
    -   Update display name, avatar.
    -   View email (read-only, linked to auth provider - Auth0).
-   **Account Management (Ref: FRD Account Security & Management):**
    -   Change password (if using password-based auth - FRD 3.1.5).
    -   Manage connected accounts (OAuth integrations, view/revoke access - might link to Integrations page, related to FRD 3.2.5).
    -   Delete account (FRD - specific requirement for account deletion).
-   **Notification Preferences (Ref: FRD Notification System):**
    -   Enable/disable different types of notifications (e.g., event reminders, updates - FRD 3.10.x).
-   **Application Preferences (Ref: FRD User Customization):**
    -   Theme (light/dark mode).
    -   Default calendar view.
    -   Timezone settings (FRD 3.3.5 related).

## 3. State Management
-   Server state (TanStack Query) for fetching and updating user settings.
-   Local component state for form handling and UI interactions.
-   Global client state (Zustand) might be used for theme preference if it affects the entire app.

## 4. UI Components
-   Settings page layout with tabbed navigation (e.g., Profile, Account, Notifications, Preferences).
-   Forms for updating profile information, changing password.
-   Toggles/checkboxes for notification preferences.
-   Dropdowns/selectors for application preferences.
-   Modals for confirmations (e.g., delete account).

## 5. User Flows
-   User navigates to the Settings page.
-   User updates their profile name.
-   User changes their password.
-   User configures their notification preferences.
-   User changes the application theme.

## 6. Technical Considerations
-   Secure handling of sensitive operations (e.g., password change, account deletion).
-   Clear feedback to the user on successful updates or errors.
-   Interaction with the API client for persisting changes.

## 7. Accessibility Considerations
-   Ensure all form elements are keyboard navigable and have proper labels.
-   Use appropriate ARIA attributes for interactive components (e.g., toggles, modals).
-   Ensure sufficient color contrast, especially for theme settings.

## 8. Testing Considerations
-   Unit tests for form validation and submission logic.
-   Integration tests for API interactions (fetching/saving settings).
-   Tests for state changes (e.g., theme updates reflecting globally).
-   Tests for modal interactions and confirmations.

## 9. Future Enhancements
-   Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) setup.
-   Export user data.
-   Activity log.
