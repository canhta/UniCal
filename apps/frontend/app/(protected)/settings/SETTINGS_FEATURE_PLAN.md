# Settings Feature Plan

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the plan for the User Settings feature, including profile management, password change, and password reset flows.

## 2. Key Features
-   **Profile Management (Ref: FRD User Profile Management):**
    -   View and update display name, avatar (protected, uses server actions where possible).
    -   View email (read-only, linked to auth provider - Auth0).
-   **Account Management (Ref: FRD Account Security & Management):**
    -   Change password (old/new/confirm, protected, server action).
    -   Manage connected accounts (OAuth integrations, view/revoke access - might link to Integrations page, related to FRD 3.2.5).
    -   Delete account (FRD - specific requirement for account deletion).
-   **Notification Preferences (Ref: FRD Notification System):**
    -   Enable/disable different types of notifications (e.g., event reminders, updates - FRD 3.10.x).
-   **Application Preferences (Ref: FRD User Customization):**
    -   Theme (light/dark mode).
    -   Default calendar view.
    -   Timezone settings (FRD 3.3.5 related).
-   **Password Management:**
    -   Forgot password (request reset email, public).
    -   Reset password (set new password with token, public).

## 3. State Management
-   Use server actions for profile/password updates where possible.
-   Use React Query for fetching user profile.
-   Local component state for form handling and UI interactions.
-   Global client state (Zustand) might be used for theme preference if it affects the entire app.

## 4. UI Components
-   Settings page with tabs: Profile, Account (password), Notifications, Preferences.
-   Profile form, password change form, forgot/reset password forms.
-   Forms for updating profile information, changing password.
-   Toggles/checkboxes for notification preferences.
-   Dropdowns/selectors for application preferences.
-   Modals for confirmations (e.g., delete account).

## 5. User Flows
-   User navigates to Settings, updates profile or password.
-   User requests password reset, receives email, sets new password.
-   User configures their notification preferences.
-   User changes the application theme.

## 6. Technical Considerations
-   Secure handling of sensitive operations (e.g., password change, account deletion).
-   Clear feedback to the user on successful updates or errors.
-   Interaction with the API client for persisting changes.

## 7. Accessibility Considerations
-   Ensure all form elements are keyboard navigable and have proper labels.
-   Use appropriate ARIA attributes for interactive components (e.g., toggles, modals).
-   Ensure sufficient color contrast, especially for theme settings.

## 8. Testing Considerations
-   Unit tests for form validation and submission logic.
-   Integration tests for API interactions (fetching/saving settings).
-   Tests for state changes (e.g., theme updates reflecting globally).
-   Tests for modal interactions and confirmations.

## 9. Future Enhancements
-   Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) setup.
-   Export user data.
-   Activity log.
